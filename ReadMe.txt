# 🚦 Traffic Monitoring System for Chardham Route  
**Enhancing Pilgrimage Safety & Vehicle Flow using AI**

![Project Flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VaibhavPo/Trafic--Monitoring-System/flowchart.png)

---

## 🎯 Objective

To **strengthen the management of people and vehicles** on pilgrimage routes, particularly along the **Chardham Yatra corridor in Uttarakhand**, using computer vision and real-time monitoring.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** – Vehicle detection  
- **OpenCV** – Frame preprocessing and filtering  
- **SORT** – Vehicle tracking  
- **Tesseract OCR** – License plate recognition  
- **Firebase Realtime Database** – Data logging and live updates  
- **Python** – Core scripting and logic

---

## 🔄 System Workflow

1. 🎥 Read live video frames  
2. 🧹 Apply filters using OpenCV  
3. 🚗 Detect vehicles with YOLOv8  
4. 📍 Track vehicles using SORT  
5. 📏 Check if the vehicle crosses a virtual monitoring line  
6. 🔎 Detect & crop number plates  
7. 🔤 Segment characters and apply OCR (Tesseract)  
8. 🧠 Parse and validate the number  
9. ☁️ Send data to Firebase for real-time use
